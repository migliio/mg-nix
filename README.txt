1 Introduction
==============

  Welcome to my personal Nix repository! Here, I store various NixOS
  configuration files that cater to different needs. This repository
  serves as a convenient way for me to manage and organize my virtual
  machines using quickemu and NixOS.

  Nix is a powerful package manager and a functional programming
  language that enables reproducible builds and declarative system
  configurations. NixOS, based on Nix, is a Linux distribution that
  embraces these principles, allowing for efficient management and
  customization of system configurations.


2 Files and usage
=================

  - `./machines': configuration files for different virtual machines.
  - `./scripts': additional scripts or utilities that assist with
    managing the virtual machines.
